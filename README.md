fuck going back in a browser button and regretting that decision. I'm writing total control over that in to my human. #self.programming

#*brain -
 
so whilst I was thinking about the future of technology and humans in a #human-owns perspective, thinking strongly "how is it possible to hand over the future of 'human' completely to the 'cloud' or AI (as we know them in our current environment in [HT:2016](#Human-time: YEAR(2016)). You see what I did there? These concepts have been around since #The-Internet was dominating the human brain processing download.  At more than one time in history the human has wondered: "is the #theinternet as a success?"
